# FluentCMS Core Provider System - Project Brief

## Project Purpose

The FluentCMS Core Provider System enables a pluggable, modular architecture for FluentCMS through discoverable, configurable, and swappable service implementations. This system allows multiple implementations of the same functionality (email providers, file storage, caching, logging, etc.) while ensuring only one provider per functional area is active at any given time.

## Core Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- **Provider Discovery**: Automatic detection of provider modules via assembly scanning
- **Provider Management**: Runtime switching between provider implementations without code changes
- **Configuration Flexibility**: Support for both database and configuration file-based provider storage
- **Thread Safety**: Concurrent access with proper synchronization primitives
- **Performance**: High-performance provider resolution with caching and optimizations
- **Dependency Injection**: Full ASP.NET Core DI container integration

### Technical Requirements
- **Modular Architecture**: Plugin-based system supporting hot-swappable providers
- **Type Safety**: Strongly-typed provider interfaces and options
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with meaningful diagnostics
- **Memory Efficiency**: Optimized assembly loading and caching strategies
- **Data Integrity**: Database constraints ensuring single active provider per area

## Key Success Criteria

1. **Easy Provider Switching**: Developers can swap providers without recompiling application code
2. **Auto-Discovery**: New providers are automatically detected when assemblies are added
3. **Production Ready**: Thread-safe, high-performance, and reliable for production workloads
4. **Developer Experience**: Simple APIs for both provider creation and consumption
5. **Configuration Management**: Flexible configuration options supporting various deployment scenarios

## Scope

### In Scope
- Core provider abstraction framework
- Assembly scanning and module discovery
- Provider lifecycle management
- Caching and performance optimization
- Database and configuration-based storage
- ASP.NET Core integration

### Out of Scope
- Specific provider implementations (these are separate packages)
- UI for provider management
- Migration tools between provider systems
- Provider versioning and compatibility management

## Architecture Overview

The system follows a layered architecture:
- **Application Layer**: Consumer APIs (IEmailProvider, IStorageProvider, etc.)
- **Provider Management**: Core system (ProviderManager, Discovery, Caching)
- **Abstractions**: Base interfaces and classes
- **Repository Layer**: Configuration and Entity Framework storage options

## Project Structure

- `FluentCMS.Providers.Abstractions`: Core interfaces and base classes
- `FluentCMS.Providers`: Main provider system implementation 
- `FluentCMS.Providers.Repositories.EntityFramework`: Database storage implementation
